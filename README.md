3)Evaluate Postfix Expression

These problems were given to me as a class assignment where we were supposed to work in teams of 4 members. 
We were given 45 minutes to solve these problems. Unfortunately, we couldn't finish the whole assignment in time.
After the lecture, I started working on it,it took approximately 5/6 hours to complete the assignment.

To complete the assignment, In One problem's solution i also took the help of AI to set the printing style.

Thanks ☺️
